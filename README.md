# Sample Hardhat Project

This is a hardhat demo based on this awesome tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ from Patrick Collins

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat run scripts/fundme.js
```

or interact with test chains by adding the RPC URLs and PRIVATE_KEY into your .env file
